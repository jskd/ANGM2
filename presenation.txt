Good morning and thank you for comming

In our presentation, I'll be talking to you about cubeSat

------------------------------------------------------------

(soufiane)

Cubesat  clasified in picosatellite and nanosatelitte it's very small compared to conventional satellites

This model is actually on the scale (En montrant la maquette)

------------------------------------------------------------
(soufiane)

Generally used for space research

- technological validations in orbit
- scientific missions including interplanetary
- new applications for civil society and defense


It's miniaturized, 1U to 12U 

exemple the model is a 3 unit

It's lowcost

- rapid development generally  3~4 years

- modular design, lot of part of older satellite is reused

- used commercially available off-the-shelf hardware and no space product 

------------------------------------------------------------

The composition is the same as a conventional satellite

It's have a Determination and Control system 

is a module for controlling the orientation of the cubesat

On-Borad computer control all subsystem of the satellite with autonomous software

it's have Communication system for receiving telecomands and send telemetrys


it's have a power systeme 

manange the baterry and receive energy from solar panel


and the most important the payload

In EyeSat it's a space camera

------------------------------------------------------------
(soufiane)

The on board computer is the main part of computer science

this role is controll all subsysteme

It's composed of STM32 microntroller and ARM cortex M7 processor 

the most popular language is C and C++ because it's a easy for manipulate register / input output and interupt

FreeRTOS is verry popular, is have lot of multithread mecanism and it's lightweight

exemple taskscheduling / semaphore / queue operations

Organise code with finite state machine is lot of used

because good for debug test and validation

------------------------------------------------------------

(jskd)

The most important point in the on-Board computer is must be autonomous

Because, in orbit it's no possible to change the software

It's important to used power efficient software coding style

- No unnecessary action in background 

example no calculate every time position if it's not use by the ADCS

- Handling speep transition seamlessly 

example no pulling the sensor value for determination of transition

- Scale Behavior Based on Machine Power State

exemple if the satelite is power low desactivate antenna and pass in suvival mode

The space contraints

- The phantom commands is activated while it is desactivated and vise versa

- Random part Failure is more rarely occur when a component no longer works.

- Single event upset (SEU) are caused by particles charged with high energy (protons, alpha particles, heavy ions)

that penetrate the components (memory, processor) and modifies the contents of the memory or the data being calculated in the processor.


------------------------------------------------------------
(soufiane)

the second segment of computer science in cubesat is Ground station

it allows to send telecom and receive telemetry

the language java is very popular, lot of open source project for space use this language

Ground station have many fonctionnality

antenna tracking is positionning the antenna for receive and send data 

change oriantation of antenna, azimuith and elevation 

(faire un de bras gauche à droite pour azimuth  et haut en bas pour elevation)

adapt the frequency for compensate the doppler shift 


------------------------------------------------------------

(jskd)

The ground station have a control command centers, is used for planify the command sended example the attitude handling

the satellite trackning is important part, it's used for orbit determination

example in this pictured, you can see the position of satelite HO-68 actuali in longitude  minus forteen dot one degrees and latitude fivety one dot four degreese


---------------------------------------------------------------
(soufiane)

As a conclusion

CubeSats facilitate access to space and offer more opportunities to innovation

Tanks for your interest 

Any question?
